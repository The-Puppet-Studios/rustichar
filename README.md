# Rustichar
 Rustichar is a program that checks how many of all the characters in a string there are

# Installation
 Make sure you have rust and cargo installed and in your path

 Then run `cargo install rustichar` in your terminal

 Then you can run the rustichar command.

# Usage
 Usage: `echo "hi" | rustichar` this will print something like:
